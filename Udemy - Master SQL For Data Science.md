🎉 **Exciting Milestone Unlocked!** 📚💻

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve successfully completed the **“Master SQL for Data Science”** course on Udemy 🚀.

This journey sharpened my SQL expertise with **PostgreSQL 🐘**, giving me hands-on experience in querying, analyzing, and managing data efficiently.

### 🗂 Key Takeaways:

🔹 Relational Databases & PostgreSQL setup (incl. port 5432)

🔹 Writing `CREATE` & `INSERT` statements

🔹 Filtering with `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `IS NULL`

🔹 Sorting & Limiting results with `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `DISTINCT`

🔹 String functions: `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `LENGTH`, `TRIM`, `SUBSTRING`, `REPLACE`, `POSITION`, `COALESCE`

🔹 Aggregations: `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `COUNT`

🔹 Grouping data with `GROUP BY` & `HAVING`

🔹 Subqueries: `ANY`, `ALL`, `CASE WHEN`, Correlated Subqueries

🔹 Joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL OUTER`, `SELF`, `CROSS`

🔹 Set operations: `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `EXCEPT`

🔹 Views & Inline Views

🔹 Window Functions: Ranking, `FIRST_VALUE`, `NTILE`, `LEAD`, `LAG`

🔹 Advanced Aggregations: `ROLLUP` & `CUBE`

💡 This course not only strengthened my SQL foundation but also boosted my confidence in applying SQL for data analysis and decision-making.

📈 Excited to put these skills into practice on real-world data projects!
