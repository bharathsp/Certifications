🧠 Just Completed – “Prompt Engineering: How to Talk to the AIs” on LinkedIn Learning! 🚀

In the age of AI, knowing how to communicate with large language models is becoming as important as coding. This course gave me an in-depth understanding of how to craft prompts that turn AI from a generic assistant into a powerful collaborator.

Here’s what I explored and mastered:

🔍 Foundations – Large Language Models, Transformer Architecture, RLHF, Diffusion Models, Zero-Shot Learning.

⚠️ Limitations – Understanding AI hallucinations and how to mitigate them.

✍️ Prompt Basics – Instruction, Question, Input Data, Examples, and combining them for better results.

📑 Prompt Templates & Examples – From beginner-friendly prompts to advanced structured prompts.

🔄 Dynamic Prompting – Using loops & variables in prompts.

🎯 Prompt Engineering in Action – Designing prompts, best practices, and real-life scenarios.

🛠 Prompt Engineering Tools – Scale Spellbook, Humanloop, Promptable, Vellum, Dust.

💡 Advanced Techniques –
Stochastic responses & tuning model parameters (temperature).
Chain of Thought prompting to improve reasoning.
<|endofprompt|> token – where, when, and how to use it.

🎓 Pro Tips & Tricks –
Order of prompting matters (instruction before example).
Affordances – designing prompts the model can “act on.”
Multilingual prompt capabilities.

This course not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me a creative edge in interacting with AI. Excited to apply these learnings in my projects and experiments!
