🚀 Excited to share that I’ve successfully completed the **Databricks Fundamentals** accreditation! 🎓✨

This journey gave me a strong foundation on the **Databricks Lakehouse Platform** 🏗️ and its ecosystem.
Here are some of the key topics I explored:

🔹 **Databricks SQL** – Querying and insights
🔹 **Lakehouse Platform** – Bridging Data Warehouse 🏢 + Data Lake 🌊
🔹 **Data Intelligence** & Generative AI 🤖
🔹 **Databricks Architecture** 🏛️
🔹 **Security & Governance** 🔐 (Unity Catalog, lineage, data sharing, compliance)
🔹 **Products & Features** – Notebooks, Jobs, Marketplace, DBFS, Photon ⚡
🔹 **Machine Learning & AI** – MLflow, Model Registry, MosaicML, Model Serving 📈
🔹 **Lakeflow** – Connect, Jobs, Delta Live Tables 🔄
🔹 **Data Formats** – Delta Lake, Iceberg, Parquet 📂
🔹 **Performance & Reliability** – Auto-scaling, Z-order clustering, Serverless compute ⚙️
🔹 **Collaboration** – Delta Sharing, Catalog Explorer, AI/BI Genie 💡

💡 Biggest takeaway: **Data Intelligence Platform = Data Lakehouse + Generative AI** → An open, unified solution to scale both **data & AI**.

Grateful to have gained a deeper understanding of how **Databricks unifies analytics, AI, and governance** across Azure, AWS, and GCP 🌐.

Excited to apply these learnings in real-world data engineering & AI/ML projects! 🚀
