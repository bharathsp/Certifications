* Nested Loop, Hash, and Sort-Merge Joins – when and how to use
* Join tuning with indexes
* Joins vs. Subqueries – choosing the right approach

📊 **Execution & Analysis**

* Query & Execution Plans
* Using `EXPLAIN` & `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in Postgres
* Query hints (enabled\_nestloop, enabled\_hashjoin, enabled\_mergejoin)
* Tuning costs: `random_page_cost`, `seq_page_cost`

🗂 **Partitioning Strategies**

* Horizontal, Vertical, Range, List, and Hash Partitioning
* Local vs. Global Indexes

🗄 **Database Maintenance**

* `VACUUM`, `VACUUM FULL`, `ANALYZE`
* Collecting statistics with `VACUUM(FULL, ANALYZE)`

📌 **Materialized Views**

* Creating & Refreshing Materialized Views

⚡ **Advanced Features**

* Parallel Query Execution
* Leveraging Data Statistics in Postgres

📚 Overall, this course gave me deeper insights into query tuning and performance optimization—critical skills for handling large datasets effectively.
